Running on Linux
================

Make sure you install the prerequisites before attempting to compile on linux:

* lua 5.1.4
* imagemagick 6.7.6.0 (for compile-time image building)
* synfig 0.63.04 (for compile-time image building)

Next clone the repository

> $ git clone git://github.com/Paamayim/adventure.git

> $ git checkout moai

> $ cd adventure

If you already have gluthost, you're good to go! Otherwise you should look into making that :)

> $ ./adventure
